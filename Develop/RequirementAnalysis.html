</div>  

<div class="body"> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The <em>supervisor</em> of a waiting room (<em>wroom</em>) of a large train station intends to promote automatic collection of the rubbish, by means of ddr robots.
To this end, some specialized robot (<em>detector</em>) periodically explores the surface of the <em>wroom</em> in order to collect objects 
made of recyclable material, in particular bottles made of <i>plastic</i> .
 
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<div class="req">
Design and build the software to put on board of the <em>plasticBox</em> and of the <em>detector</em>. The system
must be able to accept the following commands sent by the <i>smart-phone</i> of the <em>supervisor</em>:

<ul>
<li><bc>explore</bc>: the <em>detector</em> must execute the task <i>Explore the room</i>.</li>
<!-- <li><em>empty</em>:   the <em>detector</em> must execute in autonomous way  the <i>Empty the detectorBox</i> task.</li> -->
<li><bc>suspend</bc>:   the <em>detector</em> must execute the task <i>Go to home</i>. </li>
<li><bc>terminate</bc>:  the <em>detector</em> must execute the task <i>Terminate the work</i>.</li>

</ul>
Any command sent by the <em>supervisor</em> can be executed only if the room is <b>NOT</b> in the <bc>state-TVOCHigh</bc>.

The system must also include an 'agent' able to detect the <bc>state-TVOCHigh</bc> and to 
send in automatic way the command <bc>suspend</bc> to the robot. 


<br><br>
Moreover, the <i>smart-phone</i> of the <em>supervisor</em> should be automatically updated with information about:
<ul>
<li>the current  position of the robot on a map of the <em>wroom</em>. The map should also show the position of the detected non-plastic objects;</li>
<li>the space still available in its <em>detectorBox</em>;</li>
<li>the space still available in the  <em>plasticBox</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Requirement analysis</h2>
<h3>Naming clarifications</h3>


<h4>Wroom</h4>
After a discussion with the client, the wroom is defined as a flat euclidean space of rectangular shape with width w and height h.<br/> 
Moreover, the room can contain plastic bottles and other objects.<br/>
An example given by the client:<br/> 
<img src="img/roomLayout20.png" alt="wroom" width="400px">


<h4>Plastic Box</h4>
After a discussion with the client, the plastic box is determined to be a recipient of plastic bottles situated in a determined corner of the room. <br/>
It can be formalized as follow:
<ul>
<li> <strong>Structure</strong>: The plastic box its an atomic entity with its own control flow.</li>
<li> <strong>Interaction</strong>: The given requirements have no details related to the behaviour of the plastic box.</li>
<li> <strong> Behaviour</strong>: The collector works as a smart device, able to expose and update - via CoAP - its content.</li>
</ul>

//TODO INTERACTION

<h4>Detector</h4>
After a discussion with the client, the detector is determined to be a specialized robot able to execute task if a command is sent by a supervisor through a smartphone.<br/>
Moreover, the detector is equipped with a container called detectorBox that contains the bottles collected.<br/>
The detector and the task that executes can be formalized as follow:<br/>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Structure</strong>: The detector could be composed by different components but at this level its not relevant.
				Its an atomic entity with its own control flow, moreover, the detector is equipped with a detector box, a local container.</li>
<li> <strong> Interaction</strong>: The detector must be able to accept commands sent by the smart-phone of the supervisor.</li> 
<li> <strong> Behaviour</strong>: 
The behaviour of the detector is managed by the supervisor, which can tell the robot to perform a set of tasks: <br/> 
<ol>
<li><i>Explore the room</i>. This task performs the following actions:
	<ul>
	<li>explore the <em>wroom</em> in a <i>systematic way</i> in order to find static obstacles;</li>
	<li>if the obstacle is not made made of plastic, keep track of its position in the <em>wroom</em> and continue the exploration; </li>
	<li>if the detected object is made of plastic, put it (if there is space) in the <em>detectorBox</em>;
	if the <em>detectorBox</em> is full or if the room has been completely explored, execute the task <i>Empty the detectorBox</i>. </li>
	</ul>
	After discussing with the client, in a <strong>sistematic way</strong> is determined to be a specific algorithm of some sort, that makes sure that every part of the wroom is explored.<br/>
	<br/>
</li>

<li><i>Empty the detectorBox</i>. This task performs the following actions:
	<ul>
	<li>if the <em>detectorBox</em> is empty, execute the task <i>Go to home</i>;
 	</li><li>check if the <em>plasticBox</em> is able to accept the objects contained in the <em>detectorBox</em>; 
	if it cannot accept, send a message to the <em>supervisor</em> and wait for a command;</li>
	<li>otherwise, save the current position of the robot(<em>beforeEmptyPos</em>),
		then move to the  <em>plasticBox</em>, transfer into it the content of the <em>detectorBox</em> 
	and return to the task <i>Explore the room</i>, restarting from the saved <em>beforeEmptyPos</em> .
	</li>
	</ul>
	After discussing with the client, the <strong>position</strong> of the robot is determined to be the coordinates (x,y) of the robot.
<br/>
<br/>
</li> 

<li><i>Go to home</i>. This task performs the following actions:
	<ul>
	<li>return the robot to its <em>discoveryHome</em></li>	
	</ul>
	After discussing with the client, the <strong>discoveryHome</strong> is determined to be a space where the detector is situated when is not exploring.<br/>
	It is situated in a known corner of the room.<br/>
<br/>
</li>

<li><i>Terminate the work</i>. This task performs the following actions:
	<ul>
	<li>if the <em>detectorBox</em> is empty, return to the <em>discoveryHome</em>;
	otherwise, execute the task <i>Empty the detectorBox</i> and then return  to the <em>discoveryHome</em></li>	
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</li> 
</ul>

<h4>Accepting a Command</h4>
After a discussion with the client, a command is determined to be an entity that as a representation has a string. <br/>
The syntax of this string is known: explore, suspend, terminate.<br/>
After a discussion with the client, it isn't important who receives the command and how, but the detector must execute the related task. <br/>

<h4>Supervisor</h4>
The supervisor is the entity that uses the smart-phone to interact with the system.<br/> 
After discussing with the client, how the supervisor uses the smart-phone is not that important as long as it's simple and intuitive. 

<h4>Sensor Agent</h4>
After discussing with the client we defined the word 'agent' as an entity equipped with a sensor.
<ul>
<li> <strong>Structure</strong>: The 'agent' its an atomic entity with its own control flow equipped with an air quality sensor.</li>
<li> <strong>Interaction</strong>: The 'agent' its able to send in automatic way the command suspend to the robot.</li>
<li> <strong> Behaviour</strong>: The 'agent' is able to detect the sensor values.</li>
</ul>
The state <strong>TVOCHigh</strong> is determined to be an alarm state that is present when the sensor detects a value that is over a certain threshold.

<h4>Map</h4>
After a discussion with the client, a map is determined to be a representation of the wroom in coordinates (x,y) that the robot explores in step.
More in particular, every step covers a cell.<br/>
It can be formalized as follow: <br/>
<img src="img/plant0.png" alt="map" width="300px">
<br/>
Where "R" is the detector.
<h3>Functional TestPlan</h3>
<h4>Explore</h4>
After discussing with the client, the objective of this test plan is to verify that the detector is able to explore the entirety of the room, as a consequence, the entire map of the room.<br/>
<ul>
<li>At the start of the test the detector is situated in the top-left corner of the room.</li>
<li>At the end of the test the detector must have went through every cell of the map.</li>
<ul/>
