<h1>SPRINT 1 - FinalTask-ISS-2020<font size="5"></font> </h1>
</div>  

<div class="body"> 
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<div class="req">

Design and build a software system where a <em>detector</em>, equipped with a local container (<em>detectorBox</em>), is able to collect a plastic bottle positioned in front of it.<br/>
The system must be able to accept the following commands sent by the smart-phone of the <em>supervisor</em>:
<ul>
<li><bc>explore</bc>: the <em>detector</em> must reach the bottle and collect it.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Requirement analysis</h2>
<div class="remark">
<ks>GOAL</ks>: <i>i)</i> clarify the meaning of the <i>names</i> and of the <i>verbs</i> included in the requirement text given by the customer.
<i>ii)</i> define a first working prototype (and a proper set of <k>functional TestPlan</k>) as a formal model of the requirements.
</div>
<h3>Basicrobot</h3>
<h4>The QAK model</h4>
Since we have to design a heterogeneous distributed system, and since the technology to implement the robot is not defined in the requirements, it is necessary to follow a technology-independent approach.
<br/>
The software house already has a language developed ad hoc to solve the situation, the "qak" formalism, that is a meta-model represented in textual form used to expressing the structure, the interaction and the behavior of the software system. The meta-model "qak" defines in its conceptual space, the components of the software system as actors capable of exchanging messages of three types: dispatch, request, event.
<h4>The basicrobot.qak</h4>
The software house already has the code "basicrobot.qak" which already manages the situation to pilot a robot. The basicrobot actor receives the movement commands from the "detector" actor (that represents the robot's mind) and forwards them to the implementation of the robot that will execute them.
<pre>
	State work{ 
		println("basicrobot waiting ... ")
	}
	Transition t0 
			whenMsg cmd          -> handleCmd
			whenEvent userCmd    -> handleUserCmd
			whenEvent obstacle   -> handleObstacle
</pre>
To do this, the basicrobot actor needs to delegate the transmission to another qak actor called "robotadapter" (which is a CodedQActor coded entirely in kotlin) with the specific function of using the proper configuration to interface with the relative implementation of the robot, that can be virtual or physical.
<pre>
	State handleCmd {
		onMsg( cmd : cmd(X) ){
 			forward robotadapter -m cmd : cmd( $payloadArg(0 ) )
		}
	}
	Goto work
</pre>
The basicrobot also has the functionality of receiving "obstacle" events, following receipt of this event the robot enters a stop state and then switches to another state in which it moves away from the detected obstacle in order to be in a safety state.
<pre>
	State handleObstacle{
		forward robotadapter -m cmd : cmd( h )
		println("	basicrobot | stops (for safety) since  obstacle  ")
 	}
 	Goto movefarFromObstacle

	State movefarFromObstacle{
		println("	basicrobot | going back (to avoid event-generation) ")
 		forward robotadapter -m cmd : cmd( s )
		delay 100
		forward robotadapter -m cmd : cmd( h )
	}
	Goto work	
</pre>
<br/>


<h3>Detector (Maicol)</h3>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Structure</strong>: The detector could be composed by different components but at this level its not relevant.
				Its an atomic entity with its own control flow, moreover, the detector is equipped with a detector box, a local container.</li>
<li> <strong> Interaction</strong>: The detector must be able to accept the command <bc>explore</bc> sent by the smart-phone of the supervisor.</li> 
<li> <strong> Behaviour</strong>: The detector is able to collect a plastic bottle positioned in front of it. </li> 
</ul>
As previously described the software house already owns a basicrobot capable of basic commands that are exploitable to make this system. <br/>
The detector will be a QActor defined with the meta-model QAK, that extends the capabilities provided by the basicrobot. <br/>

<i>ii)</i>give a <k>quantitative measure of the effort/resources</k> necessary to build the system 
<i>iii)</i> define a (first) <k>product backlog</k>.
</div>

<h3>Raccogli problematic (Basicrobot)</h3>

<h3>Moving problematic (Detector) (Maicol)</h3>
We can assume that the robot is moving in a flat euclidean space.<br/>
The movement of the detector towards the bottle is already implemented in the set of basic commands provided by the basicrobot.<br/>
In particular is defined by the command 'w' that the detector will delegate to the basicrobot.

<h3>Communication problematic (Detector) (Maicol)</h3>
The meta-model QAK provides the possibility of 3 different communication models: 
<ul>
<li> <strong>Fire and Forget</strong>: Simple communication but the components of the system must know each other. </li>
<li> <strong>Request-Response</strong>: Same as Fire and Forget but also worse because of the quantity of messages sent. </li>
<li> <strong>Event</strong>: Components don't need to know eachother, but it's more complicated to develop because it needs an infrastructure that supports this type of communication.</li> 
</ul>
In the scenario of the interaction between the detector and the supervisor, after discussing with the client, it was concluded that a request response model is required. <br/>
The client explained that the detector must respond to the supervisor commands, but this will be further discussed in next SPRINT, for now what is decided to implement is a simple ACK response.<br/>

<h4> Application Message </h4>
A class Application message is provided within the QAK model.<br/>
This class defines a standard of communication, defining the template of the messages that are to be sent.<br/>

<h4> MQTT </h4>
The meta-model QAK gives the possibility of using a pattern mediator.<br/>
This pattern allows communication between different parts of the system, without the need of knowing 
the name of the components that you need to communicate with.<br/>
In particular, what the meta-model provides, is the possibiliy of using an MQTT broker.

<h3>The DetectorBox problematic (Detector) (Maicol)</h3>
To adopt a divide and conquer strategy the DetectorBox is an entity separated from the detector.<br/>
As a consequence the Detector Box is a QActor in the same context as the detector, that tracks the bottle that the detector has collected.

<h3>The need of a CoAP resource (Detector) (Maicol)</h3>
The code that will be developed won't be completed until some meaningful functional tests are developed and tested.<br/>
To make the testing we need some knowledge somewhere, as a consequence the necessity of a resource is born.<br/>
The resource implies a logical architecture that use an hexagonal meta-model.<br/>
The QAK model that was already discussed, is provided of a Californium extension that permits already to make use of resources.<br/>

<h3>The ProductBacklog</h3>
<strong>DETECTOR</strong>: the robot mind that delegate to the basicrobot the behaviour to do to collect the bottle. <br/>
<strong>BASIC ROBOT</strong>: extension with a new command to collect the bottle. <br/>
<strong>VIRTUAL ROBOT</strong>: extension to permit to show a bottle and collect it. (This virtual space is used for testing)<br/>
<strong>FRONTEND</strong>: Button to comunicate an explore message and a label to show the bottle inside the detectorBox.

<h3>The Effort/Resources</h3>
<h4>Detector and Detector Box development (Maicol)</h4>
Thanks to the already developed and tested basicrobot and the features provided by the QAK model, the detector is just a component that implements the logic to be delegated to the basicrobot.<br/>
A time of 1 hour is estimated.

<h2>Test plans</h2> 
The results to be achieved in this first sprint can be summarized through a single simple final test. This test involves the positioning of the robot and a plastic bottle inside a room. The robot must reach and collect the bottle just by moving forward with the assumption that there are no obstacles between the robot and the bottle.
<pre>
@Test
public void sprint_1_Test() {
	CoapClient readerClient = new CoapClient("coap://localhost:5683/wroom/detectorBox");
	assertTrue("there's no bottle in detector box", readerClient.get().getResponseText().equals("0"));
	
	try {
		MqttClient publisherClient = new MqttClient(broker, clientId, persistence);
		MqttConnectOptions connOpts = new MqttConnectOptions();
		connOpts.setCleanSession(true);
		publisherClient.connect(connOpts);
		assertTrue("client is connected?", publisherClient.isConnected());
		MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage(msgContent.getBytes());
		message.setQos(qos);
		publisherClient.publish(detectorTopic, message); // send the forward command to robot
		publisherClient.disconnect();
		publisherClient.close();
	} catch (MqttException me) {/* handle exception ... */}
	
	try {
		Thread.sleep(5000); // wait for robot reach the bottle ...
	} catch (InterruptedException e) {/* handle exception ... */}
	assertTrue("detector has found and collect the bottle in 5 seconds?", readerClient.get().getResponseText().equals("1"));
}
